# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-10)

**Core value:** Recovery + load tracked over time -- long-term insight into how the body responds to training
**Current focus:** Phase 18 — cycle-aware-recovery-baselines

## Current Position

Phase: 18 (cycle-aware-recovery-baselines) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 (complete)
Status: Phase 18 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-25 -- Completed 18-02 (cycle-aware recovery pipeline integration)

Progress (v1.4 milestone): [████░░░░░░░░░░░] 29% (2/7 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 52 (v1.0: 14, v1.1: 9+, v1.2: 11)
- Average duration: carried from v1.2
- Total execution time: carried from v1.2

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 phases 1-4 | 14/14 | -- | -- |
| v1.1 phases 5-8 | 9+ | -- | -- |
| v1.2 phases 9-12 | 11/11 | -- | -- |
| 13 | 3 | - | - |
| 14 | 2 | - | - |
| 15 | 3 | - | - |
| 16 | 2 | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.3 Research]: Design polish ships first so all new v1.3 UI inherits correct font/borders
- [v1.3 Research]: 30-day share link expiry, 8-char alphanumeric codes
- [v1.3 Research]: All LLM calls via Supabase Edge Function proxy -- API key never in iOS binary
- [v1.3 Research]: Apple Vision for OCR, PDFKit for PDF extraction -- zero new iOS dependencies
- [v1.3 Research]: gpt-4o-mini with JSON Schema structured output for workout parsing
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 18-02]: Same-phase baselines wired into RecoveryPipeline.run via optional CycleTrackingService; D-04 gate + read-time RecoverySnapshot x MenstrualCycleSnapshot join over ~3-cycle window; nil-service path identical to 7-day

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Alpino PostScript name must be verified with Font Book before writing Font.custom() strings
- AASA file hosting on tutrice.app domain needs verification for universal links (share codes are fallback)
- OCR accuracy on handwritten content is unreliable -- scope Phase 16 as "printed/typed text only"
